    "Say you're the city manager of Austin planning a free concert. Woah big city! And a heck of a music scene! This seems like a big task, and you want to know about how many people will come so you can plan ahead and order the right amount of food. You don't need an exact headcount because ordering is done in bulk. So you would like to know the approximate proportion of the city that will show up in 10% groups (10%, 20%, 30%, etc). Because you've been the city manager for a few years, you have some prior knowledge of these concerts and believe at least 20% of the town will show up, but not more than 90%. You also believe the 60% and 70% groups are 3X as likely as the others. What is the estimated proportion of the city that will show up? \n",
    "\n",
    "You're pretty savvy, and send out an email asking if people will attend the concert. You send it out to 200 people and 123 respond 'yes' and 73 respond 'no'. Now you know this proportion of attendance (123/200 = 0.615) is not the real estimate because surveys are not always accurate and people do change their minds. So, you want to employ some statistics to help you estimate the most likely proportion of people that will come.\n",
